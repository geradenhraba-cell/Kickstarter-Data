<h3>Overview</h3>

I wanted to explore the trends of Tabletop roleplaying games from various crowdfunding sites to see what kind of systems tend to get funded over others. By looking at several websites and pulling data from each and then comparing each indivudally to compare at the end. By analyzing each site i can look at their funding goals, release year, rather or not they got cancelled early, funded, or lost funding to compare them. I wished to understand where and when these projects were most successful.

<h3>Motivation</h3>

TTRPG's have been a large facet of my adult and adolecent life. I wished to see if there was any significant growth in the kickstarter community, and to see which type of RPG's are most likely to succeed or not. I wanted to see where the scene has changed over the years if one type of game was by far the most funded or and if there was a year where things changed drastically.

<h3>Data Sources</h3>

The data that is presented has been gathered from four websites.
