<h3>Overview</h3>

I wanted to explore the trends of Tabletop roleplaying games from various crowdfunding sites to see what kind of systems tend to get funded over others. By looking at several websites and pulling data from each and then comparing each indivudally to compare at the end. By analyzing each site i can look at their funding goals, release year, rather or not they got cancelled early, funded, or lost funding to compare them. I wished to understand where and when these projects were most successful.
